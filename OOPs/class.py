# To map with real world scenarios, we started using objects in code.
# This is called object oriented programming.

# first we were using procesural programming means that line wise codes
# then introduces function meaning reducing redundency and increasing reusability
# now to deal with real world scenarios python introduces OOPs concepts

# Class & Objects in Python: Class is a blueprint for creating objects.

# Creating class
class Student:
    name = "Adarsh Tiwari"

# Creating object(instance)
s1 = Student()
print(s1.name)
